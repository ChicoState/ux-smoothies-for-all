# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction
Smoothies For All is working on a simple yet important task: helping everyday people easily find smoothie recipes. We want to make sure that everyone can get these recipes without having to go through a pay wall. This means that if you're looking for a new and tasty smoothie to try, you won't have to spend any money to find great ideas. The goal is to make it straightforward for anyone to enjoy making and drinking smoothies without the hassle of dealing with hidden costs or complicated instructions.

## Methods

The smoothies for all prototype contained 5 tasks for the users to complete for the usability test. 

The following questions were surveyed to 7 participants

Create an account and start viewing smoothie recipes.
    Task Description: Focused on the starting page and creating an account.
    What We Hope to Learn: We want to see if users can easily sign up and start using the app. We want to know if there are any confusing steps.

Find a way to post your smoothie recipe for everyone to see.
    Task Description: Users tried to share their own smoothie recipes.
    What We Hope to Learn: We want to know if posting a recipe is easy and clear. We are looking for any problems users might have.

Leave feedback on a recipe that you liked.
    Task Description: Users left comments on a smoothie recipe they enjoyed.
    What We Hope to Learn: We want to see if users can easily leave feedback. We need to know if the feedback feature is easy to find and use.

Update your profile for everyone on the app to see.
    Task Description: Users updated their profile information.
    What We Hope to Learn: We want to know if updating the profile is easy. We are checking if users can make changes without problems.
    
Find a way to save your favorite recipe and find out where it got saved.
    Task Description: Users saved a favorite recipe and found where it was stored.
    What We Hope to Learn: We want to see if saving and finding recipes is simple. We need to know if users can easily access their saved recipes.

These questions were framed in a way that challenges people who are unfamiliar with our software to try and navigate it. While they navigate it, we can discover how easy/difficult the tasks were, what needs to change in our design thought process to be more user-friendly.
We asked our participants to use the “think aloud” strategy, which proved to be very valuable since we can check if what our intended user thought process matched an actual user’s thought process.

## Findings

The Data from our user testing is as follows:
    Task 1: Create an account and start viewing smoothie recipes
        All participants completed the task successfully.
        Time taken ranged from 3 seconds to 30 seconds, with most participants completing it within 5 seconds.
        All participants rated the task as "Easy" (Rank 5).
    Task 2: Post your smoothie recipe for everyone to see
        All participants completed the task successfully.
        Time taken ranged from 1 second to 33 seconds.
        The majority rated the task as "Easy" (Rank 5), except one participant who rated it 3.
    Task 3: Leave feedback on a recipe that you liked
        All participants completed the task successfully.
        Time taken ranged from 5 seconds to 45 seconds.
        All participants rated the task as "Easy" (Rank 5).
    Task 4: Update your profile for everyone on the app to see
        All participants completed the task successfully.
        Time taken ranged from 5 seconds to 1 minute.
        The majority rated the task as "Easy" (Rank 5), with one participant giving it a 3.
    Task 5: Save your favorite recipe and find out where it got saved
        All participants completed the task successfully.
        Time taken ranged from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.
        Most participants rated the task as "Easy" (Rank 5), with a couple rating it 3.


Frustrations and Additional Features:
    Some participants found it difficult to find saved favorites.
    Suggested added features included:
    * Tracking calories
    * Multiple photos per post

Overall Trends and Insights:
    Ease of Use: Most tasks were rated as "Easy" and completed quickly, indicating the app is user-friendly.
    Positive Reception: Users liked the design and user interface, which contributed to a positive overall experience.
    Feature Requests: Users desire additional features such as better navigation, enhanced content management (more pictures, multiple photos per post), and functional improvements (favorites section, filters).
    Minor Frustrations: A few participants struggled with finding saved recipes and suggested improvements for better usability.

## Conclusions

We found that most of our users experienced problems with task 5, which was the task to save a post and view where these saved posts are
Our prototype was also incomplete in several ways, such as no animations, no confirmation buttons or success buttons. Missing key dynamics such as the image upload or profile customization. We also had some bugs such as the the bookmark button marking all the posts as bookmarked, etc.
We found that our tasks were relatively easy, or simple enough to accomplish. Most users are already familiar with various social media platforms, so they were able to breeze through most of our tasks.
We gathered useful data we wouldn’t have gathered through alternative methods, such as adding favorite tabs, filters, home bar/nav bar, feedback animations, etc.
We were actually pleasantly surprised to get a lucky crowd of participants that actually for the most part regularly make smoothies, to which our social media app appealed to most of our participants.
Caveats
Test fatigue: participants were taking up to 3 back to back tests, this could cause them to become disinterested with surface level feedback.
Participant prior experience: our pool of participants were selected from a class of experienced UX students who are familiar with technology and interface design, this could lead to unrealistic results that don’t correlate with our target consumer.
First time test & prototype designers: this is the first time anyone in our UX group has created a usability test or prototype. Given our inexperience, there are prototype features and questions we could definitely tweak to improve the overall quality of responses we receive.
Single proctor test: each test was given by a single member of our UX team, this meant one person was both giving the test and recording the responses. I think by splitting this work we could improve both the quality and engagement of the test given and answers recorded.
Executive Summary
Most tasks were generally easy for participants, despite challenges due to their familiarity with other social media platforms,
Gained valuable insight such as favorite tabs, filters, feedback animations, nav bar, etc.
Test fatigue had a large part in our experimentation as both participants and examiners. This could have had implications on our study and refining our testing.
Task 5, which consisted of saving and locating saved posts, seemed to be the most difficult of the bunch, and could be improved with favorites tab rather than being inside of profile.
Generally good and positive feedback despite a prototype containing bugs/incomplete features. Most suggestions were rather minor, the prototype was largely well received, with a task taking no longer than 45 seconds for all participants.
