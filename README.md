# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Goal: making finding smoothie recipes people enjoy easy and free
* We performed competitive analysis, created personas and scenarios, a low fidelity design artifact, and performed heuristic evalulations.
* Competitive analysis showed that their is a market for both a **free and "smoothie specialized" social media application** . 
* Users want something **convient and efficient** 
* Use of personas and scenarios reinforced findings that: users will be **health conscious individuals and want a convenient way to find new smoothies**.
* Our sketches highlighted our vision for a **simple UI that is efficent and easy to use**.
