# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Goal: making finding smoothie recipes people enjoy easy and free
* We performed competitive analysis, created personas and scenarios, a low fidelity design artifact, and performed heuristic evalulations.
* Competitive analysis showed that their is a market for both a **free and "smoothie specialized" social media application** . 
* Users want something **convient and efficient** 
* Use of personas and scenarios reinforced findings that: users will be **health conscious individuals and want a convenient way to find new smoothies**.
* Our sketches highlighted our vision for a **simple UI that is efficent and easy to use**.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* Our objective is to simplify the discovery of enjoyable, healthy and  free smoothie recipes for everyone.
* Competitive analysis revealed a strong market for a specialized, free smoothie application focused on convenience and efficiency.
* Development of personas and scenarios helped us understand our target users: health-conscious individuals seeking easy recipe discovery.
* Heuristic evaluations emphasized the importance of a **simple, intuitive user interface**.
* Findings indicate a need for improved search functionality, clear user feedback mechanisms, and community engagement features like a **"smoothie of the day"** highlight and a recipe-sharing forum.
* Future development will concentrate on these enhancements to create a **user-centric platform** for smoothie enthusiasts globally.

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**

* Most tasks were generally easy for participants, despite challenges due to their familiarity with other social media platforms,
* Gained valuable insight such as favorite tabs, filters, feedback animations, nav bar, etc.
* Test fatigue had a large part in our experimentation as both participants and examiners. This could have had implications on our study and refining our testing.
* Task 5, which consisted of saving and locating saved posts, seemed to be the most difficult of the bunch, and could be improved with favorites tab rather than being inside of profile.
* Generally good and positive feedback despite a prototype containing bugs/incomplete features. Most suggestions were rather minor, the prototype was largely well received, with a task taking no longer than 45 seconds for all participants.
