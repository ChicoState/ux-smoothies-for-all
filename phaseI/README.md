# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Smoothies For All is working on a simple yet important task: helping everyday people easily find smoothie recipes. They want to make sure that everyone can get these recipes without having to pay. This means that if you're looking for a new and tasty smoothie to try, you won't have to spend any money to find great ideas. The goal is to make it straightforward for anyone to enjoy making and drinking smoothies without the hassle of dealing with hidden costs or complicated instructions.


## Methods

The following methods in which we utilized to discover various insights for Smoothies for All include, competitive analysis, personas & scenarios, heuristic evaluations, and low fidelity design artifacts. Our UX team selected 5 various applications in which our team deemed as competitors to our product. These applications were: Instagram, Daily Blends Recipes, Prevention.com, Allrecipes.com, Foodnetwork.com. Our team evaluated each application with 5 categories being: strengths, weaknesses, quality level, price/cost, and platform. 

Our sketch that we collectively created gave us a visual representation of our vision for the application, which will give us our first step when we create our wireframes in the near future. Our heuristic evaluation rated 10 various usability heuristics which included: Visibility of System Status, Match between system and real world, User control and freedom, Consistency and Standards, Error prevention, Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility and efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors, help and documentation. The app which we decided to rank these usability heuristics against was Instagram since we figured not only was it the most popular of the 5 previously looked at apps, but because it was also one we were all most familiar with and could give fair and valuable feedback towards. Our heuristic evaluation gave us some pointers in the direction of where our competition might lack, and where we can capitalize on.

Our personas allows our UX team to brainstorm what our users could potentially look, think, and what their common interests/ideologies would look like. It gave our team an understanding at how users might want to interact with our application and what they would expect upon using our app.

## Findings

By using competitive analysis, our UX team found that the type of individuals who we think would use our application was somewhat diverse, but still focused. Individuals who may have the most interest in using “Smoothies For All'' include those looking for a way to make their drinks more interesting, those with busy schedules, and generally people who want to pursue a healthy lifestyle. After analyzing similar products, we also realized there is a demand for this kind of product in a form that is free to the consumer.

Our Heuristic Evaluation on “Instagram” revealed to us some interesting information as well. Being a dominant product in the market right now, there's a lot we can learn from this application, two of which stick out the most are “User Control and Freedom” and “Flexibility and efficiency of use”, which both scored 10 for our evaluation. We would like to adapt some of the features that work great on Instagram toward our application. A few shortcomings Instagram has that we would like to avoid are “Help and documentation” which scored a 2 and “Error prevention” which scored a 5. 

The personas and scenarios for “Smoothies for All '' provided us a clear vision on why customers might use our application. This then gave us insights as to what features they may need and what usability options are important to their experience using our application. We found that the use of personas and scenarios reinforced findings in other analysis methods, more specifically we found that most of our users will likely be health conscious individuals that want a convenient way to find new smoothies. 


## Conclusions

Our UX team discovered that our app might likely be used by those that want to cut out a lot of the mainstream additives and want something streamlined, and simple. It would be a good idea to make our app as simple and meaningful as possible. Also creating extra features for the smoothie enthusiasts to keep them around, such as calorie counts, local fruit prices, in season smoothies etc. Overall collectively we constructed a well put together early vision that we all have for the app and ground we should be covering.

## Caveats

The caveats our UX team has identified is that the app is designed in a way that it represents what we think a user might want without any data to back that fact up. This means we're designing based on what we think people might like, rather than actual feedback. Also, figuring out exactly who will love our smoothie recipes has been tough. We're aiming to appeal to a wide variety of people, which makes it hard to really pinpoint what specific features our diverse group of future users might need or want from our product.
