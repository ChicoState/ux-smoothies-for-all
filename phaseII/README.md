# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Smoothies For All is working on a simple yet important task: helping everyday people easily find smoothie recipes. We want to make sure that everyone can get these recipes without having to go through a pay wall. This means that if you're looking for a new and tasty smoothie to try, you won't have to spend any money to find great ideas. The goal is to make it straightforward for anyone to enjoy making and drinking smoothies without the hassle of dealing with hidden costs or complicated instructions.

## Methods

For phase-2 we had **5 external UX evaluators** perform cognitive walkthroughs in order to observe how users interacted with our application. The personas used in these walkthroughs were: Johnathan, Amanda, and Albert(3x). To perform these walkthroughs, each external UX evaluator navigated through a scenario in a wireframe of our application as a persona of a potential user. For each persona/scenario we set out to answer two questions: "Will the user know what to do at this step?" and "If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?".

WT1: "Amanda wanted to find a healthy but nice treat for her boyfriend after work" This walkthrough helped us determine that users may get confused when logging into the application, for instance Amanda doesn't know if the application remembers credentials or not. This walkthrough of Amanda also brought up that she was confused on how to manually search for a specific kind of smoothie she wanted. So neither of our questions were completely answered.

WT2: "I am trying to find ideas for smoothies to make" Our first question for this walkthrough was answered as Johnathan was able to scroll through the application and browse for different smoothies to try, but was stuck when he could not find a search bar. Our second question was "somewhat" answered, as Johnathan can access recipes he has favourited through the profile page.

WT3: "Wants to find ideas for smoothies to make" For each step of this walk through both questions were able to be answered. Albert was able to: Scroll on the home page until he found a smoothie he liked, read about the smoothie that caught his eye, and follow the steps to make the smoothie.

WT4: "Wants to find ideas for smoothies to make" This walk through was again with Albert but yielded a different analysis. Albert did know what to do at each step but was unsure if everything worked as intended. This leads into the second question not being answered, as Albert had no error/approval messages telling him if he was on the right or wrong track.

WT5: "Be able to view his favorite smoothie recipes in the morning while making breakfast" Albert will be able to successfully log into the application and will know this is successful because the login button will disappear. After this Albert can click onto the favorites tab to view his favorite recipes,verifying that it works.

In addition to cognitive walkthroughs, we also gathered some **informal feedback** from an unbiased group that demoed the current application.


## Findings
WT1: We found some issues with the confusion of being thrown into the app, also how recommendations are going to be offered to users. The big critique here was not being able to fine tune the user's specific needs and tastes for their feed. Does the application save user authentication information or do you need to re-log in? Important question for our team.

WT2: This walkthrough was rather positive in the light that the user was able to accurately navigate our wireframe to achievce their goal, a big take away that our user had here was that there wasn't a search or filter to limit or narrow the options given to our user of the main navigation page. This is definitely something that would help all of our users' experiences and will have to be implemented.

WT3: In this walkthrough we found that the user was able to do everything that Albert needed to do, they were able to to continually make progress to their goal.

WT4: Here we saw a very important and valuable lesson that we needed to see, and was something that we wouldn't have caught if it weren't for users testing our wireframes. That is that we don't have any success of failure signs meaning that users will be able to wander mindlessly through the app not knowing if they are doing something that they are supposed to be doing or not. This was a great finding and is something we have to implement. On a smaller note, the user noted that log in and out aren't as clear as they should be.

WT5: This walkthrough was relatively simple, we found that this user's intuition led them to believe that the like button will add the posts to their favorites as it was initially intended.

From our informal feedback, we asked them, what features would you like seen added to this app? The feedback we got was that users would like a "smoothie of the day" feature. We also asked, what improvements would you like to see added to our UI? The feedback received from this was that users wanted a forum for the recipes, as right now we have recipe discovery as a feed.


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
